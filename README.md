# My solutions to Project Euler problems in Haskell

**See** [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) for background

## Steps:
* Ensure that you have [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)
and [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/downloads) installed:

* Install the project's dependencies, and compile:
```sh
stack build
```
*  Run the problems:
```sh
stack exec project-euler-exe
```

If you want to run the tests:
```sh
stack test
```
**Note:** Some of the solutions to the problems take 15 seconds or more, so be patient!
